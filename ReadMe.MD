# Brain Tumour Segmentation

This project focuses on automated brain tumor segmentation using advanced deep learning and computer vision techniques applied to 3D medical imaging. Traditionally, this task is time-consuming and manually intensive for radiologists. By automating the process, the project aims to significantly reduce segmentation time while improving consistency and accuracy, ultimately supporting faster diagnoses and more reliable clinical decision-making.
